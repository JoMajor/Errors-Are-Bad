Trying to implement error correction 

Hi, I'm brand new to this. Reasonably technical, decent math skills. 

On a mission to gain a practical knowledge of error correction so that I can test different methodologies, select methods appropriates to problems. I have access to a solid programming group, and would work with them to actually get the coding done.
